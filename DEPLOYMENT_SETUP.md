## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Render.com** or your hosting platform:
   - Set `MONGODB_URI` environment variable in hosting dashboard
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Service will auto-deploy

2. **Access Deployment Status**:
   - Navigate to `/deployment` to verify all systems are operational
   - Monitor API health and MongoDB connectivity

3. **Start Using the Marketplace**:
   - Navigate to `/` for the home page
   - Sign up or sign in to create accounts

## 🔐 Security Notes

- MongoDB Atlas connection uses SSL/TLS encryption
- Render outbound IP ranges to whitelist in MongoDB Atlas Network Access:
   - `74.220.48.0/24`
   - `74.220.56.0/24`
- JWT tokens expire after 7 days
- Seller accounts require admin approval before they can list items
- CORS is configured to only allow specified origins

## 📞 Support

For MongoDB issues:
- Check MongoDB Atlas dashboard for connection logs
- Verify IP whitelist includes your deployment environment
- Ensure retryWrites is enabled (already in URI)

For API issues:
- Check server logs: `npm run server`
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Check CORS configuration if frontend can't connect
